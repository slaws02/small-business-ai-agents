# Architecture Notes (Portfolio)

This portfolio uses a consistent “Agent Spec” pattern to make outputs reliable and demo-friendly.

## Agent Design Pattern

Each agent includes:

1. **Role**
   - Clear identity and mission (e.g., “Margin Protection Agent for ecommerce sellers”)

2. **Inputs**
   - Explicit fields so the agent asks minimal follow-ups

3. **Constraints / Guardrails**
   - When to warn, when to refuse, when to escalate (e.g., legal/tax advice boundaries)

4. **Output Schema**
   - Fixed sections and formatting for predictable results

5. **Quality Checks**
   - The agent verifies completeness and flags missing inputs

## Why This Matters

Small businesses don’t need “general chat.”
They need repeatable deliverables:
- listings
- pricing decisions
- offers
- content calendars
- customer messages

This portfolio demonstrates applied AI design that connects directly to business outcomes.
