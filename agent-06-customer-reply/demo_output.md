Hi there! Thank you so much for reaching out — I’d love to help you get this in time for your photos. I can ship within 1–2 business days, and we can choose the fastest available shipping option at checkout. Because carrier transit times can vary, I can’t guarantee Friday delivery, but if you’d like, tell me your ZIP code and I’ll confirm the quickest shipping method available today.

2) Policy Alignment Check
- References processing time (1–2 business days)
- Avoids guaranteeing carrier delivery dates

3) Next Best Action
- Ask for ZIP code
- Offer expedited shipping option
- Provide the earliest estimated delivery window shown by Etsy/carrier

4) If Customer Escalates (backup reply)
I completely understand the timeline. If Friday delivery is a must, I don’t want to overpromise. If the fastest option won’t meet your date, I can help you cancel right away so you can choose something local.
