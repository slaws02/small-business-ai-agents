2) Upsell + Cross-sell Pairings
- Headband → add pins “for extra hold”
- Headband → add storage box “for travel + keepsake”
- Pins → add comb “for veil or side-sweep”

3) Promo Ideas (margin-safe)
- Free storage box upgrade over $150
- Limited-time “Add pins for 20% off” (only on add-on item)
- “Buy 2 accessories, get gift wrap free”

4) Clearance Strategy
- Pair slow-moving comb as a discounted add-on in bundles rather than discounting it standalone

5) Implementation Notes

- Show bundles in one image tile or a collage mockup

6) Assumptions + Questions
